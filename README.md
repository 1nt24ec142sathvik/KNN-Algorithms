 # Some Stock Market terminologies📊📉📈

OPEN is the price of the stock at the beginning of the trading day (it need not be the closing price of the previous day).

High is the highest price of the stock at closing time.

Low is the lowest price of the stock on that trading day.

Close is the price of the stock at closing time.

Volume indicates how many stocks were traded.

Adjusted Close is the closing price of the stock that adjusts the price of the stock for corporate actions.

While stock prices are considered to be set mostly by traders, stock splits (when the company makes each extant stock worth two and halves the price) and dividends (payout of company profits per share) also affect the price of a stock and should be accounted for.
